# Node API 4 Guided Project

Guided project for **Node API 4** module.

In this project we will learn how to deploy a Web API to `heroku`.

## Prerequisites

- Sign up for a free account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Instructions

Please fork this repository and follow along **using your fork** as the instructor deploys the API to `heroku`.


A few different ways to stand up a web server with an IP address:

- Self host our own applications from our own computers at home.
- Rent a server from a hosting company. (Up to us to turn it into a functioning server with software installed etc.)
- Use a web hosting service (like Netlify or Heroku that do the above ^ for us.)
